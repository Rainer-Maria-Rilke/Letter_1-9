My dear Mr. Kappus,
During this time that has passed without a letter, I have been partly traveling,
partly so busy that I couldn’t write. And even today writing is difficult for me,
because I have already had to write so many letters that my hand is tired. If I
could dictate, I would have much more to say to you, but as it is, please accept
these few words as an answer to your long letter.
I think of you often, dear Mr. Kappus, and with such concentrated good
wishes that somehow they ought to help you. Whether my letters really are a
help, I often doubt. Don’t say, “Yes, they are.” Just accept them calmly and
without many thanks, and let us wait for what wants to come.
There is probably no point in my going into your questions now; for what I
could say about your tendency to doubt or about your inability to bring your
outer and inner lives into harmony or about all the other thing that oppress you
— : is just what I have already said: just the wish that you may find in yourself
enough patience to endure and enough simplicity to have faith; that you may
gain more and more confidence in what is difficult and in your solitude among
other people. And as for the rest, let life happen to you. Believe me: life is in the
right, always/
And about feelings: All feelings that concentrate you and lift you up are pure;
only that feeling is impure which grasps just one side of your being and thus
distorts you. Everything you can think of as you face your childhood, is good.
Everything that makes more of you than you have ever been, even in your best
hours, is right. Every intensification is good, if it is in your entire blood, if it isn’t
intoxication or muddiness, but joy which you can see into, clear to the bottom.
Do you understand what I mean? And your doubt can become a good quality if you train it. It must become
knowing, it must become criticism. Ask it, whenever it wants to spoil something
for you, why something is ugly, demand proofs from it, test it, and you will find
it perhaps bewildered and embarrassed, perhaps also protesting. But don’t give in,
insist on arguments, and act in this way, attentive and persistent, every single
time, and the day will come when instead of being a destroyer, it will become one
of your best workers — perhaps the most intelligent of all the ones that are
building your life.
That is all, dear Mr. Kappus, that I am able to tell you today. But I am
sending you, along with this letter, the reprint of a small poem that has just
appeared in the Prague German Labor. In it I speak to you further of life and
death and of how both are great and glorious.
Yours,
Rainer Maria Rilke
